These source files are provided for use on Linux x86 machines. For use of
these files on other platforms you must use appropriately compiled
libraries (for Mesa/GL and netpbm).

Read the comments at the top of image.c image_view.c and image_view2.c to
see how to create the imaging executables.

100 ppm files are included (sampled from a Star Wars movie). You can
recycle through these frames if you want your movies to last longer.

The sockets directory contains source code for simple TCP and UDP routines
and should be self-explanatory. These are almost the canonical versions of
TCP/UDP sockets code and I've used them for many projects. 

..and finally, don't forget to setup your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable to use the imaging binaries. For tcsh/csh, something like:

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./lib/netpbm:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} is required.

For bash/sh etc, try:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib/netpbm:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Have fun!

Rich.
